# Wafer-Scale-Laser-Integration
The scripts here are used for data analysis for on-chip laser measurements with the following primary functionality:
- extract different kinds of data (OSA, LIV, benchtop, etc) in csv files and save in .mat with certain plots
- analyze multiple OSA data
- analyze multiple LIV and wavelength meter data
- compare between benchtop and on-chip laser measurements
